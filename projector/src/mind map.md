# IdeaTree

## Transcendence and Full Inclusion of
- textual languages
- projectional languages
    - textual
    - visual         
- bootstrapping the system on itself

## Projector Layers and Parts

### T0 - common typed data model
- serialization
    - JSON low-level
    - binary later 
- heaps
    - tree nodes
        - primitive properties
        - references
        - children
- colaboration sync features

### Language Definition Language - Meta Meta model
- concepts

- fluent as textual
- projectional otherwise
    - tokenized syntax tree (later found out similar in Harmonia / Tree Sitter)
